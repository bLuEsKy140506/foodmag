      "title": "Grilled Corn with Flavored Butters",
      "author": "Amanda Neal",
      "text": "Buttery grilled corn is one of our favorite summer dinner staples. It’s even better with a trio of seasoned butters—think Cajun, miso and green goddess—served in shallow bowls so everyone at the table can roll an ear in their favorite flavor. Make the butters ahead of time, then pull them out of the refrigerator right before serving. It's hard to beat homemade Cajun seasoning, but feel free to use store-bought if you’re short on time. If you have leftover butter, serve it with your favorite vegetables, from boiled baby potatoes to grilled asparagus, or use it to top grilled steak or fish.",
